### About

This application has as an objective to search for human body hashes through re-Id in video captures and return their label.

For now, an user will have to upload a video and the application will search a given person's body hash through the frames,
given that the body hash has been saved in the database. 

## Features

Currently, the app will have the following features implemented:

- **User Management**  
  - **Admin routes**
    - Create a user (`POST /users`) 
    - Find a user (`GET /users/:userId`) 
    - Find all users (`GET /users`) 
    - Delete a user (`GET /users`) 
    - Create a person's hash (`POST /people`)
    - Delete a hash (`DELETE /people/:personId`)
    
  - **User routes** 
    - List all users hashes (`GET /people`)
    - Find a hash (`GET /people/:personId`)
    - Upload video (`POST /videos`)
    - Find your videos (`GET /videos`)
    - Find a video (`GET /videos/:videoId`)
    - Delete you video (`DELETE /videos/:videoId/delete`)
    - Find people on video (`GET /people/:videoId/find`)
    - Register a user (`POST /register`)
    - Edit profile (`POST /profile`)
    - Login a user (`POST /login`)
    - Logout a user (`POST /logout`)
